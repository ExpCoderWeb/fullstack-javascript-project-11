### Brief introduction
There is a special format representing web news feeds, article annotations, and other content called **RSS**. This is the easiest way for websites (usually blogs) to enable users to subscribe to updates. For this purpose, special services called RSS aggregators are used. These services can check RSS web feeds for updates and conveniently display them, marking what they have read, and so on.

### Project overview
**RSS Reader** is a RSS feeds aggregator that provides the ability to add an infinite number of RSS feeds. The content of each feed is automatically updated every 5 seconds and new posts are included to the main stream.

### Requirements:
- Unix terminal
- Node.js: 18.x or higher

### Setup
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ExpCoderWeb/fullstack-javascript-project-11.git
```

```bash
cd fullstack-javascript-project-11
```

```bash
make install
```
Then, there are 2 options:

`make develop` - _for local launch_

`make build` - _for application build_
